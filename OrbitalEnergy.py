# We will define a dictionary of dictionaries to contain all the energy terms.  The top-level keys will be different types of terms: nonspinning, spin-spin, etc.  The dictionaries they contain will give those terms at different PN orders.

# The tidal-coupling terms come in to the energy at relative 5pN order, and are known to 6pN order.
# 
# These terms come from Eq. (2.11) of [Vines et al. (2011)](http://prd.aps.org/abstract/PRD/v83/i8/e084051).  Note their unusual convention for mass ratios, where $\chi_1 = m_1/m$ in their notation; in particular, $\chi$ is not a spin parameter.  Also note that $\hat{\lambda} = \lambda_2 v^{10}/(m_1+m_2)^5$, and we need to add the coupling terms again with $1 \leftrightarrow 2$.  Finally, note the normalization difference, where the overall factor is different by $-2$.
