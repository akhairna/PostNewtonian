      "This notebook collects algorithms for evolving or evaluating (in nonprecessing cases) the orbital evolution of the PN system.  The primary approximants are denoted TaylorT$n$ for $n \\in [1,5]$.  \"Taylor\" means that they are Taylor series (as opposed to Pad\u00e9), \"T\" means that they are in the time domain (as opposed to frequency), and $n$ just numbers the order in which they were established in the literature.  The other important approximant is TaylorF2, which is based on TaylorT2, but is in the frequency domain."

      "These very similar approximants are the simplest in construction, and most widely applicable.  In particular, they can both be applied to precessing systems.  Each gives rise to the same system of ODEs that need to be integrated in time, except that the right-hand side for $dv/dt$ is expanded as a series in $v$ and truncated for TaylorT4.  TaylorT5 extends that simply.\n",

      "***** The version of TaylorT5 output below is slightly different from the one introduced by Ajith.  He further solved analytically for the orbital phase $\\Phi$ in terms of $v$.  This doesn't appear to be possible in the precessing case, since terms such as $\\vec{\\Sigma} \\cdot \\hat{L}_{\\text{N}}$ now vary with $v$ in nontrivial ways.  Besides, we have 11 variables to integrate besides $\\Phi$, so it's not much extra burden to integrate it too.  For nonprecessing systems, similar code could be generated for the non-precessing case using Ajith's solution for $\\Phi$; the value of `y[1]` would have to be reset explicitly at the top of the `TaylorT4RHS` function emitted below."
